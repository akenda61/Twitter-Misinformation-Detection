Abstract: The global use of social media is set to increase further while at the same time introduce the challenge of
preventing misinformation being spread into wider society. News consumption via social media is increasingly being
used for this purpose as it is low cost, provides easy access and enables rapid dissemination of information. Therefore,
misinformation detection on social media posts has become an emerging theme, attracting tremendous attention at
national government level. In this paper we outline our approach and methodology towards developing a Proof of
Concept machine learning solution for detecting misinformation in Twitter Feeds (Tweets) in which we achieved an
accuracy of 99.3% in detection performance. We also briefly describe an integration approach of our work into the
wider IT business architecture with view to highlighting a potential misinformation detection service. The work
presented in this paper was in direct response to an open AI competition set by the NATO Communications and
Information Agency (NCI), where the emphasis was to submit an entry for the best performing detection model
category.
